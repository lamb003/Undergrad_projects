===========

Calculation of geoid-ellipsoid seperation using spherical harmonics.

Reads in a gravity model, and the geographical coordinates of ground stations where seperation is to be determined.
Outputs the seperation for all ground stations.

Note: The program only opperates till degree 85 as that was the memory threshold for python in terms of holding large numbers.
